Omg, just got outta watching Jumbo. I’m all over the place tbh, it’s like, did I just experience a cinematic rollercoaster or did an elephant sit on me??? The theater was loud, some kids wouldn’t stop kicking my seat, my popcorn’s spilled everywhere, but like, whooo cares, right? Cuz Jumbo is just LOUD in your face awesome, but also like, soft... like if you were in a marshmallow avalanche? Too much sense, maybe?

> Sooo, there’s this hyper-color scene where Jumbo, the not-so-typical elephant, kinda just dances through a candy-colored dreamscape — trippy much?? It’s like if Willy Wonka had an elephant at his factory, this’d be it. Should probs tell you to download the movie if you’re feeling like a daydream.

In some part, I think I felt my brain go fuzzy — might’ve been the sugar rush from too much soda or maybe the freaking neon lights! Honestly, the storyline’s a bit like my WiFi signal, strong and clear then poof, just all over the place. But who even mentioned plot when your eyes are feasting in an all-you-can-watch buffet of COLORS and sound!!! God, my back’s killing me but worth it.

Did you notice how Jumbo felt like a silent hero? Like, it gives huge Pixar vibes even tho... it's not. Like a sweet nostalgia hug and then bam you're crying over an elephant’s struggle. Do I remember who I was before watching this or did the movie turn my brain into rainbow-flavored jelly??? 

You gotta watch the movie when you get a chance!! Just to see if it leaves you in a thinking-bubble like me. This film felt like trying to piece together a dream you barely remember after waking up — ‘s all jumbled but gooood!

def jumbo_experience():
    colors = [‘neon’, ‘pastel’, ‘candy’]
    for color in colors:
        print(fWow, such {color} and feelings!)
    return elephant.real_emotions() or brain_candy()

My friend asked how it was... um, what? Oh yeah, anyway, just... go see it for yourself, it’s kinda like trying to explain why the sky looks different after a storm, you just gotta see it.
